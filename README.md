# SonarQube
SonarQube For Code Quality &amp; Security Management Tool 

1)SonarQube is a code quality and security management tool that performs static code analysis to identify:
•	Bugs.
•	Code smells (maintainability issues).
•	Security vulnerabilities.
•	Compliance issues (e.g., OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25).

2)Why is SonarQube Important for Source Code Security?
Security Benefits:
•	Detects vulnerabilities in the code that hackers can exploit, such as SQL injection, hardcoded credentials, and weak encryption.
•	Flags insecure coding practices that may lead to future breaches.
•	Assesses third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs).

3)Key Features
•	Multi-Language Support: SonarQube supports .NET and 30+ other programming languages.
•	Easy Integration: Works with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, Azure DevOps) to automate analysis.
•	Clear Reporting: Provides a dashboard that visualizes code quality and security status, making it easy to track progress.
•	Continuous Improvement: Tracks quality over time, encouraging a culture of continuous improvement.

4)How Does SonarQube Work for Source Code Security Checks?
1.	Static Analysis:
    Scans the source code to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and other issues without executing the application.
2.	Rules-Based Checks:
    Uses pre-configured and customizable rules to enforce coding standards and security best practices.
3.	Reports and Alerts:
    Generates detailed reports highlighting the severity and location of issues, prioritizing fixes.
4.	Continuous Integration:
    Integrates into the development workflow, performing automatic checks during the build process.
